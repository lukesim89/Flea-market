Bang Bang control - step input into the hulk (bang bang - control is restricted to an upper and a lower bound)
  Idea:setup hulk input to be step instead of gradual, 
  Problem: not as simple as adjusting gain, if we turn up the gain to max, the falling of the hulk is a product of the joystick input
           and the dyanmics of the hulk. If the gain is too high, it would just become user operator oscilliations.
           
  Questions: are the same pattern of errors in continuous control seen in discrete (bang bang/step input)? are there new ones?
             How to people transition from contiuous to discrete and vice versa
             Are the same corrective movements seen in continuous also seen in discrete?
             
             
             plateu at different levels (
             fallrate (600)
             is it intermittency or joystick magnitude deflection 
             what does it say about basic science? what is it tha tpeople are trying to show in bang bnag control
             what parameters you want to adjust.
             what are the benefits of bang bang vs continuous and vice versa
             proportional control - the action taken, the feedback is IN PROPORTION to the degree the system diverages from the ideal point (continuous)
             two-step controller/on-off controller/hysteresis controller("hysteresis" means a lag in response to change)
             
             a light switch is bang bang, but while the input is on/off, you can add a additional "variable resistor"
             are there advantages of bang bang over conventional proportional control? 
              (1) easier to program/implement
              (2) allows investigation of human strategy under constrained conditions?
