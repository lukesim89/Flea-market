Hypothesis: 1) frequency of spontaneous destabilizations increases as task-relevant-information (TRI) decreases
              1.1) frequency of spontaneous destabilization decreases as a TRI increases. (inversely proportional)
            2) implicit vs explicit strategies for visuomotor adaptations are independent (participant's explicit...
               strategy will not influence motor system's rate of adaptation)
            
            
          
Scintilating dots(1) vs distractor task(2) (both reduce the amount of information present but through different mechanisms. 
1)




setup: randomize pendulum location and velocity (cannot be entirely random because its really easy to estimate the pendulum is going to...
crash if its +90degrees per second and near crash boundary). Show participants pendulum for 500ms. blank screen with masking stimulus
Question: have participants estimate where the pendulum will be after 1 second masking delay, 2 second, 3 second, 4 second and 5 seconds. 
Ask participants "what is the change in pendulum posiition between when u last saw it and 1 second later... 4 and 5 seconds later.
Ask participants: use joystick to input a single pulse that would bring the PENDULUM as close to the DOB as possible (bang bang vs proportional control)
Ask participants: verbally report what angle the pendulum will be at (range -90:90) and how fast it is moving.
