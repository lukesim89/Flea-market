Forcing participants into a discrete setup. Does it explain what happens during actual balance?

how can we get a response tha cannot be explained/predicted by feedback?

What about having participants view the pendulum first a few trials, then get them to play. does just viewing it help improve after performance?


what does it mean if delay or changing coefficients has a effect? what does it mean if there is no effect?

bring participants into lab, naive subjects are given the setup and make estimations. to prove that they arent just estimating it based on 
velocity or some other factor and that they have indeed internalized the model, we will bring them in again and have them do the same experiment 
but change certain paramters of the VIP model e.g., fall rate joystick gain etc. if we see a persistant error, it will suggest
that the participant is not just relying on context cues and is actually going off his own internal model.

We then measure their AI?
