Broad objective
  Why do people make destabilizing movements? What are the processes underlying destabilizing movements (Spontaneous and transitional)
  
    **Exploratory**
    We  know that reactive destabilizing are a result from excessive  input either due to  slow reaction time or lapse in concentration
    Q1)  How do neural correlates (EEG imaging of the cortex) differ between the three different destabilizions (i.e., spontaenous vs reactive vs transitional).
    Q2)  What characteristics (Neural or behavioural)  allow us to distinguish between the 3 catergories?
    Q3)  Are we able to predict destabilizing movements through the observation of neural correlates?
    Q4)  Can we use a classifier in conjunction with ERN signals to determine subject intention?
    Q5)  Do these destabilizing movements differ from person to person or even within the same subject?
    Q6)  Understanding the contribution of different wavelengths for different destabilizing commands   
    Q7)  Dyadic task, math equation describing a persons' skill level and how it compliments a person of similar or different skill level (disparity analysis)
    
    **Application**
    Q1)  Can we use distinguishing characteristics to prevent either (1) subject from producing destabilizing movement or (2) correct an executed destabilizing movement
    Q2)  Training program for pilots/drone control facilitate learning process (graded assistance). counteract floor effects.
    
    
    
    
Tasks to-do
    1) 2 ERN papers to support Q4(exploratory)
    2) Meet Eric fields/Sekuler
    3) Aly and Gutsell (EEG setup details)
    4) Demographic (3)
    5) Matlab code (pipeline)
    5.5) pump all data through pipeline
    6) Matlab code (destabilization description code) *add code snippets.
    7) Matlab code for ideas of classifier (nearest K, Support vector machine, linear  discriminant analysis, discrete wavelet transform

    
    
    
    
    Update: meeting with Paul and Jim 9/20/2019 1330hrs-1430hrs
    Focus on ERP of Spontaneous and ERN
    Consider controlling for motor areas and see if other components exists
    think about methods section (what we need to put in etc)
    Eye movement future idea?
    demographics and behavioural data for predicting good vs bad vs average individuals
    distribution of commands. if spontaneou command at 13.42 seconds. what happened before? is there a consistent pattern of spont - spont -react repeating?
    Find a control (we rather not run any more experiments)
