Broad objective
  Why do people make destabilizing movements? What are the processes underlying destabilizing movements (Spontaneous and transitional)
  
    **Exploratory**
    We  know that reactive destabilizing are a result from excessive  input either due to  slow reaction time or lapse in concentration
    Q1)  How do neural correlates (EEG imaging of the cortex) differ between the three different destabilizions (i.e., spontaenous vs reactive vs transitional).
    Q2)  What characteristics (Neural or behavioural)  allow us to distinguish between the 3 catergories?
    Q3)  Are we able to predict destabilizing movements through the observation of neural correlates?
    Q4)  Can we use a classifier in conjunction with ERN signals to determine subject intention?
    Q5)  Do these destabilizing movements differ from person to person or even within the same subject?
    Q6)  Understanding the contribution of different wavelengths for different destabilizing commands   
    Q7)  Dyadic task, math equation describing a persons' skill level and how it compliments a person of similar or different skill level (disparity analysis)
    
    **Application**
    Q1)  Can we use distinguishing characteristics to prevent either (1) subject from producing destabilizing movement or (2) correct an executed destabilizing movement
    Q2)  Training program for pilots/drone control facilitate learning process (graded assistance). counteract floor effects.
